# Intergrid

Intergrid is a limited recreation of [Indigrid](https://innovationdilation.com/) in React. Like its parent image, Intergrid is a text-only, keyboard-oriented tool for note-taking and outlining. It does not support images, tables, links (including internal links), embeds, or anything beyond mere text. (Worth noting that the original has a hidden feature where `#hashtags` are highlit in plain text.)

This simplicity makes Indigrid (and, by extension, Intergrid) easy to operate.

## Why?

I wanted to practice my React skills on a personal project with no deadlines or clients eagerly awaiting results.

## Goals

The primary goal of Intergrid is a faithful-but-limited implementation of Indigrid. Most of the features in the latest version of Indigrid (33) are intended to be added eventually.

Things are are outside of the scope of this app:

-   bookmarks
-   to-do functionality
-   replicating data structure precisely

You can fork this project and implement it as you see fit, within the requirements of the license supplied with this repo.
